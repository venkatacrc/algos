Here's a summary of the requested deep learning models, including their architectures and typical loss functions:

## Image Recognition Models (CNN-based)

**1. LeNet-5 (1998)**
* **Architecture:** One of the earliest successful Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It consists of alternating convolutional (with learnable filters) and subsampling (pooling) layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification. Uses `tanh` activation functions.
* **Loss Function:** Typically **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for regression-like tasks (e.g., digit recognition outputting a vector of probabilities), or a form of **cross-entropy** for classification.

**2. AlexNet (2012)**
* **Architecture:** A deeper and wider CNN than LeNet-5. Key features include:
    * Five convolutional layers, some followed by max-pooling layers.
    * Three fully connected layers.
    * Uses **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions, which helped with faster training.
    * Employs **Dropout** to prevent overfitting.
    * **Local Response Normalization (LRN)** layers (though later found less critical).
* **Loss Function:** **Softmax with Cross-Entropy Loss** for multi-class classification.

**3. VGGNet (2014)**
* **Architecture:** Characterized by its simplicity and depth. It uses very small ($3 \times 3$) convolutional filters throughout the network, stacked multiple times before pooling layers. This consistent and repetitive structure makes it easy to understand and implement. Different versions (VGG16, VGG19) refer to the number of layers.
* **Loss Function:** **Softmax with Cross-Entropy Loss**.

**4. GoogLeNet / Inception (2014)**
* **Architecture:** Introduced the "Inception module," which performs multiple convolutions (e.g., $1 \times 1$, $3 \times 3$, $5 \times 5$) and pooling operations in parallel on the same input, then concatenates their outputs. This allows the network to learn diverse features at different scales. It also uses $1 \times 1$ convolutions for dimensionality reduction to manage computational cost (bottleneck layers). The network is deeper and wider while being computationally efficient.
* **Loss Function:** Primarily **Softmax with Cross-Entropy Loss**. It also used auxiliary classifiers during training to combat vanishing gradients in deep networks, with their own cross-entropy losses summed into the total loss.

**5. ResNet (Residual Network) (2015)**
* **Architecture:** Introduced "residual connections" or "skip connections" that allow the output of a layer to be added directly to the output of a later layer, bypassing one or more layers. This helps in training very deep networks (e.g., ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNet-152) by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and degradation problem. The core building block is the "residual block."
* **Loss Function:** **Softmax with Cross-Entropy Loss**.

**6. DenseNet (2017)**
* **Architecture:** Builds on the idea of connectivity by connecting every layer to every subsequent layer within a "dense block." This means the input to any layer is the concatenation of the feature maps of all preceding layers. This promotes feature reuse and helps in addressing vanishing gradients.
* **Loss Function:** **Softmax with Cross-Entropy Loss**.

**7. EfficientNet (2019)**
* **Architecture:** Focuses on uniformly scaling network dimensions (depth, width, and resolution) using a compound coefficient. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs by systematically balancing these scaling factors. Uses MobileNetV2's inverted bottleneck convolution as its building block.
* **Loss Function:** Typically **Softmax with Cross-Entropy Loss**.

**8. ConvNeXt (2022)**
* **Architecture:** A "modernized" ConvNet that incorporates insights from Vision Transformers (like larger kernel sizes, inverted bottleneck blocks, and fewer activation functions/normalizations) to achieve competitive performance with Transformers while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of traditional CNNs.
* **Loss Function:** Often **Softmax with Cross-Entropy Loss** for classification.

## Vision Transformer (ViT) and Transformer-based Vision Models

**9. Vision Transformer (ViT) (2020)**
* **Architecture:** Applies the standard Transformer architecture (originally for NLP) directly to images. Images are split into fixed-size patches, linearly embedded, and positional embeddings are added. These sequences of embedded patches are then fed into a standard Transformer encoder (multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers).
* **Loss Function:** Typically **Cross-Entropy Loss** for image classification.

**10. SAM (Segment Anything Model) (2023)**
* **Architecture:** A promptable segmentation system. It consists of three main components:
    * **Image Encoder:** A Vision Transformer (ViT-H) that processes the input image once to produce a high-quality image embedding.
    * **Prompt Encoder:** Encodes various prompts (points, bounding boxes, masks, text) into embeddings.
    * **Mask Decoder:** A lightweight Transformer-based decoder that takes the image embedding and prompt embeddings to predict object masks.
* **Loss Function:** During training, SAM uses a combination of **focal loss** and **Dice loss** to optimize mask prediction.

**11. DINO (Self-distillation with no labels) (2021)**
* **Architecture:** A self-supervised learning method that uses a "teacher-student" architecture. Both student and teacher networks have the same architecture (often a ViT). The student learns to predict the output of the teacher network, where the teacher's parameters are an exponential moving average of the student's parameters. A "stop-gradient" operator is applied to the teacher to prevent trivial solutions.
* **Loss Function:** **Cross-Entropy Loss** between the softmax outputs of the student and teacher networks, with temperature scaling.

**12. CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) (2021)**
* **Architecture:** Trains an image encoder (e.g., ResNet, ViT) and a text encoder (e.g., Transformer) to learn joint embeddings. It aims to maximize the similarity between correct image-text pairs and minimize it for incorrect pairs within a batch.
* **Loss Function:** **Contrastive Loss**, often implemented as a symmetric cross-entropy loss over similarity scores (e.g., dot product) between image and text embeddings.

## Multimodal and Generative Models

**13. Early Fusion Models (General Concept)**
* **Architecture:** In multimodal learning, early fusion combines data from different modalities at an initial stage, typically by concatenating or merging raw data or low-level features before feeding them into a single deep learning model. For example, concatenating image pixels with text embeddings.
* **Loss Function:** Depends on the specific downstream task (e.g., **Cross-Entropy** for classification, **MSE** for regression). The goal is to learn a joint representation.

**14. Show and Tell (Image Captioning) (2015)**
* **Architecture:** An encoder-decoder architecture.
    * **Encoder:** A CNN (e.g., Inception v3, ResNet) extracts a fixed-length feature vector from an input image.
    * **Decoder:** A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), typically an LSTM, generates a sequence of words (the caption) based on the image features.
* **Loss Function:** **Cross-Entropy Loss** for sequence generation, where the model tries to predict the next word in the caption given the previous words and the image features.

**15. VQA (Visual Question Answering) Models (General Category)**
* **Architecture:** VQA models typically combine visual information (from a CNN or ViT) and textual information (from an RNN or Transformer) and fuse them to answer a question about an image. Architectures vary widely, but common elements include:
    * Image encoder.
    * Question encoder.
    * Fusion mechanism (e.g., element-wise product, concatenation, attention mechanisms like co-attention).
    * Answer prediction head (often a classifier for multiple-choice or a decoder for generative answers).
* **Loss Function:** Often **Cross-Entropy Loss** for classification (e.g., choosing from a predefined set of answers) or a combination of losses for generative VQA (e.g., cross-entropy for word prediction).

**16. ViLBERT (Vision-and-Language BERT) (2019)**
* **Architecture:** A two-stream Transformer model. It has separate BERT-like Transformers for processing visual and textual inputs, with co-attentional layers that allow information to be exchanged between the two streams at different layers. This enables rich multimodal representations.
* **Loss Function:** Pre-trained with multiple tasks including:
    * **Masked Multi-Modal Modeling (MMM):** Predicting masked words and visual features (using **Cross-Entropy** for words and **regression loss** for features).
    * **Multi-Modal Alignment (MMA):** A binary classification task to determine if an image-text pair is aligned (using **Binary Cross-Entropy**).

**17. LXMERT (Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from Transformers) (2019)**
* **Architecture:** Another Transformer-based multimodal model with three encoders: an object relationship encoder (vision), a language encoder, and a cross-modality encoder that facilitates interaction between visual and linguistic features.
* **Loss Function:** Pre-trained with various losses, including:
    * **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):** **Cross-Entropy**.
    * **Masked Object Prediction (MOP):** Regression for bounding box features and classification for object classes.
    * **Visual-Language Text Alignment (VLA):** A binary classification to predict if a sentence describes an image.
    * **Object Relationship Modeling (ORM).**

**18. DALL-E (2021) / DALL-E 2 (2022)**
* **Architecture:**
    * **DALL-E:** A Transformer model that takes both text and image tokens as input and generates images. It uses a discrete VAE to compress images into a sequence of discrete codes, which are then treated like text tokens. The Transformer then autoregressively predicts these image tokens.
    * **DALL-E 2:** Improves upon DALL-E by using a two-stage process:
        1.  **Prior:** A Transformer model that maps text captions to a CLIP image embedding.
        2.  **Decoder:** A diffusion model that generates an image from the CLIP image embedding.
* **Loss Function:**
    * **DALL-E:** **Cross-Entropy Loss** for predicting the next image token.
    * **DALL-E 2:** The prior is trained with a **regression loss** (e.g., L2) to predict the CLIP image embedding. The diffusion decoder uses a **denoising loss** (e.g., MSE) typical of diffusion models.

**19. Flamingo (2022)**
* **Architecture:** A family of large visual language models designed for few-shot learning. It combines a powerful pre-trained vision encoder (e.g., ResNet or ViT) with a pre-trained large language model (LLM). It introduces "Perceiver Resampler" modules to convert sequences of visual features into a fixed number of tokens, and "gated cross-attention" layers inserted between the LLM's frozen layers to condition the LLM on visual information.
* **Loss Function:** Trained end-to-end for various vision-language tasks, typically using **Cross-Entropy Loss** for text generation or classification, conditioned on visual input.

**20. PaLM-E (2023)**
* **Architecture:** A large embodied multimodal language model. It extends the PaLM (Pathways Language Model) architecture to incorporate various sensor modalities (images, 3D states, robot states) alongside text. It treats these multimodal inputs as "multimodal sentences" of latent vectors, which are fed into the LLM, enabling it to perform tasks like robotic manipulation, visual question answering, and embodied reasoning.
* **Loss Function:** Trained end-to-end with tasks involving sequential decision-making for robots, visual question answering, and captioning. The specific loss functions would depend on the task, but for language generation, **cross-entropy** is common.

**21. GPT-4 (2023)**
* **Architecture:** A large multimodal Transformer model. While details are proprietary, it's known to be a decoder-only Transformer. It can accept both text and image inputs and generate text outputs. The image encoding likely uses a pre-trained Vision Transformer.
* **Loss Function:** Primarily **Cross-Entropy Loss** for next-token prediction, scaled for the massive number of parameters and training data. For multimodal inputs, it likely involves a joint loss that aligns representations and enables coherent generation.

**22. Gemini (2023)**
* **Architecture:** A family of multimodal models developed by Google AI, designed to be natively multimodal, handling text, images, audio, and video inputs. They are based on the Transformer architecture and optimized for various sizes (Ultra, Pro, Nano). They aim for strong reasoning capabilities across modalities.
* **Loss Function:** Details are proprietary, but for training a natively multimodal model, the loss would involve a combination of objectives that align representations across modalities and optimize for various downstream tasks (e.g., **cross-entropy** for generation, **contrastive losses** for alignment).

**23. Sora (2024)**
* **Architecture:** A text-to-video diffusion model by OpenAI. It operates on "patches" of video and uses a Transformer architecture for generating coherent video sequences. It can generate videos from text prompts and extend existing videos.
* **Loss Function:** Typical of diffusion models, it likely uses a **denoising loss** (e.g., **MSE**) to predict the noise added to latent representations, and potentially other losses to ensure temporal consistency and adherence to text prompts.

**24. V-JEPA (Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture) (2024)**
* **Architecture:** A self-supervised video model that learns by predicting masked segments of video in a learned representation space. It uses a vision encoder (e.g., a ViT) to extract representations from video frames. It's a non-generative approach, focusing on learning predictive representations rather than pixel-level reconstruction.
* **Loss Function:** The core loss is a **mask-denoising feature prediction objective**, where the model predicts the representations of masked video patches. This is a form of **reconstruction loss** applied in the latent space.
