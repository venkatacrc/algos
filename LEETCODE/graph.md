# Graph Algorithms - LeetCode Problems

Graph problems involve **nodes and edges**, and solving them typically requires **DFS**, **BFS**, **Topological Sort**, **Union Find (DSU)**, or **Shortest Path (Dijkstra/Bellman-Ford)**. This markdown lists core graph problems grouped by difficulty and Meta interview frequency.

## ✅ Notes on Meta Asked Problems

- Meta often asks **DFS/BFS traversal** in grid or custom graph formats.
- **Topological sort**, **Union Find**, and **Shortest Path** variants like Dijkstra are essential.
- **Course Schedule**, **Clone Graph**, and **Reconstruct Itinerary** are common favorites.

## 👨‍💻 Graph Traversal - DFS Template

```python
def dfs(node, visited, graph):
    if node in visited:
        return
    visited.add(node)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        dfs(neighbor, visited, graph)
```

## 👨‍💻 Graph Traversal - BFS Template

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start, graph):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            queue.append(neighbor)
```

## 👨‍💻 Union Find (Disjoint Set) Template

```python
def find(x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent[x])
    return parent[x]

def union(x, y):
    parent[find(x)] = find(y)
```

## 👨‍💻 Dijkstra’s Algorithm Template

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(start, graph):
    heap = [(0, start)]
    dist = {start: 0}
    while heap:
        d, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if d > dist[node]:
            continue
        for nei, wt in graph[node]:
            if nei not in dist or d + wt < dist[nei]:
                dist[nei] = d + wt
                heapq.heappush(heap, (dist[nei], nei))
```

### LC 2265 Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree

```python
"""
Approach:
    DFS post Order traversal
"""

class Solution:
    def averageOfSubtree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        ans = 0
        def dfs(root):
            nonlocal ans
            if not root:
                return 0, 0
            
            ls, ln = dfs(root.left)
            rs, rn = dfs(root.right)

            total_elems = 1 + ln + rn
            total_sum = root.val + ls + rs

            if total_sum // total_elems == root.val:
                ans += 1
                       
            return total_sum, total_elems
```
