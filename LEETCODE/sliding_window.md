## ðŸ§  Tips for Sliding Window

- **Fixed-size window**: Use when the size of the window is constant (e.g., size `k`).
- **Variable-size window**: Useful when conditions are dynamic (e.g., distinct characters, sum â‰¥ target).
- **Data structures**: Use hashmaps, sets, deques, heaps depending on problem needs.

> âœ… Pro Tip: Practice both fixed and dynamic window problems to master this pattern. Sliding window is commonly tested in interviews due to its efficiency.
