## ‚úÖ Notes on Meta Asked Problems

- Meta consistently asks questions that combine **Sliding Window + HashMap/Set** (e.g., LeetCode 3, 76).
- Understand how to handle **dynamic window sizes** based on constraints like character frequency or distinct counts.
- Practice window-shrinking conditions carefully ‚Äî they‚Äôre key to optimal solutions.

```python
def sliding_window(s):
    left = 0
    window = defaultdict(int)
    
    for right in range(len(s)):
        window[s[right]] += 1
        
        while condition_to_shrink_window:
            window[s[left]] -= 1
            left += 1
        
        # Do something with window
