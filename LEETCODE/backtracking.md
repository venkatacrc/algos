## ‚úÖ Notes on Meta Asked Problems

- Meta frequently asks **classic combinatorics problems** like permutations, combinations, and subset generation.
- **Board-style backtracking** (e.g., Word Search, N-Queens, Sudoku) also appear frequently.
- Clean recursion, pruning, and path tracking are key to optimizing solutions.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Backtracking - Template

```python
def backtrack(path, options):
    if base_case:
        result.append(path[:])
        return
    for i in range(len(options)):
        # choose
        path.append(options[i])
        # explore
        backtrack(path, options[:i] + options[i+1:])
        # un-choose
        path.pop()
